          Barcelona. July, 2018. 
Everlasting nights, the taste of gin and tequila still on the lips, the spires of the gothic quarter embracing the first daylight. Soft sounds, distant cheers in the hazy light. 
The scent of clubs. Crossing paths with people from every corner of the world. Not just people, timeless stories intertwined into an infinite dance. Falling in love with these stories, feeling how they become part of you. 

Nights with undertones by Kiasmos, syncopated beats by Jon Hopkins, scratching and unexpected basses by Max Cooper are all the foundation and the heart in this postcard. 
Nights where the obscure vocals of the “old town” carry you to the dancefloor to feel how little else you need to exist - just this moment and its everlasting memory. 

In this setting, two former colleagues find themselves having to share a living space of 25m sq. for a couple of months. In this crucial time of their lives, they discover they share a profound passion for electronic music. With just a white Maschine Studio and a chair in the limited space. 

Violins, piano notes, deep basses and asynchronous flows merge with awareness of growth, of solitude, of love lost, of love reencountered. 
Once Again is born. Music for listening, music for dancing, music for crying, music for coming back to life. Music to listen to one more time, Once Again.

          With a background in classical music education, Once Again is a duo that thrives to bring together a multitude of musical influences, merging them into a collection of danceable tunes and relatable emotional landscapes. 

Their first project, “Gateway to the Continent”, is a journey through different stages of self-exploration, narrated through wordless storytelling made of an alchemy of classical, rock and dance floor elements. A delicate build up of downbeats takes listeners on a journey of pursuing and longing, before an overlay of dynamic melodies pulls them out to experience a triumphant transformation.
